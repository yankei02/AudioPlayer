# Automated Page Turn Audio Player for Performers and Composers

This project aims to create a seamless experience for performers and composers by automating page turns and synchronizing score and audio files in real-time. The tool allows performers to add markers to their score, eliminating the need for manual tracking and ensuring smoother coordination during performances.

## Features

- **Automated Page Turns**: Add markers to automatically trigger page turns in the score.
- **Audio and Score Synchronization**: Coordinates audio playback with score progression, reducing missed cues.
- **Customizable Markers**: Users can set custom markers for specific locations in the score, linking them to audio playback.
- **Improved Performer Experience**: Streamlines the performance workflow by eliminating distractions related to page-turning and manual tracking.
